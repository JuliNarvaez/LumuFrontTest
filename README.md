## Q&A:

1. Explain what is the computational complexity of your word frequency counting algorithm.

- The main complexity was count every repeated word depending of the response from the api and get the top three. 

### How it works:

I created an array map of 'keys:values' that can raise depending of how much words the api return, where the name of the word is the key and the value is how many times is repeated.
